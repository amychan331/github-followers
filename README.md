## Description
A React web app that allows user to search using a Github handle name. THe search returns the account's phone and followers count, along if a list of the account's followers. If the account have many followers for initial search, an "Load More" will appear if user would like to see more.

<!-- README
Description of the problem and solution.
Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
Link to your resume or public profile.
Link to the hosted application.
Therefore, feel free to mention in your README how much experience you have with the technical choices you make, we will take note of that when reviewing your challenge. (React is older, but never jest before - part of the reason to use React is because it comes with testing, so there is no setup.)
please detail in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

<!-- ASSESSMENT
Architecture: how clean is the separation and construction of the application?
Clarity: does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained?
Correctness: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
Code quality: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable? Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
Testing: how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change? Are there some unit and some integration tests? * We're not looking for full coverage (given time constraint) but just trying to get a feel for your testing skills.
UX: is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use?
Technical choices: do choices of libraries, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?
